excerpt: 'Zimbabwe conducts Malaria Indicator Surveys after 3 years and Demographic and Health Surveys to track the impact of malaria interventions. The last one to be conducted was in 2016 and had set an aim aimed to collect data to track malaria indicators as well as to save as the baseline source for the Malaria Strategic Plan (2016–2020). The results indicated that some progress has been made in malaria control although there is still subsequent low malaria risk perception that comes with the reduced prevalence. It has been shown that there is low use of interventions shown by the low use of LLINs by vulnerable groups like pregnant women and children under five.'
