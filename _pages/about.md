Substantial experience of working in resource-challenged settings and have experience coordinating with international donors/ funders, including Presidential Malaria Initiative (USAID), DFID, Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis, and Malaria. I have a proven track record on surveillance systems setting up and implementation, capacity building, grant writing, and program review processes; the specific case was setting of a real-time system for malaria elimination case-based surveillance through District Health Information System 2 (DHIS 2) in Zimbabwe.
