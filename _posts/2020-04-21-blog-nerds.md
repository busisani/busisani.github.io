Welcome to the launch of the new and improved Busisani website and my first blog post! My name is Jamie Hord of Busisani Dube and I am so excited to share with you MORE of what Horderly has to offer! The amount of ideas, how-toâ€™s and inspiration whirling around in my head is ready to jump out. I wanted to start by telling you why I created this blog, what you will be seeing more of in my posts, and my overall experience of revamping my website.
